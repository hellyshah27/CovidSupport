                <p>CovidSupport platform is concentrate the UN goal number 3 which is for Healthy life and Well Being. 
                There are 17 UN sustainabilty development goals, but we are focusing on the one which is about ensuring   
                healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages because of the current situation about the pandemic. 
                Covid-19 is affecting more and more number of people and some of the nations are facing difficulties so this 
                CovidSupport will provide them help in some of the way.</p>

                <p>Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. Currently, 
                the world is facing a global health crisis unlike any other — COVID-19 is spreading human suffering, destabilizing 
                the global economy and upending the lives of billions of people around the globe.</p>

                <p>Health emergencies such as COVID-19 pose a global risk and have shown the critical need for preparedness. The 
                United Nations Development Programme highlighted huge disparities in countries’ abilities to cope with and recover 
                from the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic provides a watershed moment for health emergency preparedness and for investment 
                in critical 21st century public services.</p>
